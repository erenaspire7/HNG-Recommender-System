Team C++ Recommender System
I guess we can say, the journey has really began for us on the Machine Learning. After we passed our 
first task building basic image classification for plate numbers, the 'hello world' of Machine Learning as 
we can clearly see, we were asked to form groups and thus team C++ emerged, the task was given as 
follows;
Task 3 - ML: Recommender System
Task: You are to build a Recommender System for lucid.blog.
1. This system should suggest who to follow and what articles to read for a user.
2. You will be given a database to select the necessary features needed, perform Exploratory Data 
Analysis, build a model and make it available to be tested. Testing: You are to create a ReadMe file 
on github.com detailing how the model you built can be tested (not model accuracy).
This test can either be a Command Line Interface script or tested from CoLab directly. Any way you see 
fit for your model to be tested.
Submission: You are to submit as a group. Push all your codes (SQL queries, Notebooks, Python Files, 
etc) to a github repository.
Then this repo link will be posted for it to be tested.
Lucid Database 
Sample: https://res.cloudinary.com/xyluz/raw/upload/v1569153455/lucid\_2\_erhfgo.rar
Immediately tasks were released, we set to work and broke it down to basic ideas. For easy 
understanding, I outlined the process we followed, we;
*	Brainstormed to actually understand the task,
*	Decided on a recommender system method; content based
*	Loaded database, then realized it was way too scanty to neither train nor test, so we raised our 
concerns and the mentors gave a richer database.
*	Analyzed database to remove outliers and pick relevant tables; we first had issues reading the 
dataset as it was in SQL and we only mostly knew how to manipulate CSVs, but we were able to 
work round it and started coding. All hands were on deck contributing ideas and codes too.
*	Next, we Cleaned
*	Then we built the model 
*	Tested it
*	Cleaned it further
*	Added more codes and put finishing touches
*	Then we Tested with test data and pushed to group repo for submission.
The entire task took roughly 3 days and 4 nights, yes you read right, in coding, days are separate from 
nights as a whole lot can happen in between.
So, there you have it, our recommender system for Lucid
